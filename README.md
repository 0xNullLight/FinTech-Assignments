These assignments aren't meant to be copied & is meant to be as a showcase of my skillsets thus far.
The grades are hid away to keep the mystery there to discourage exact copies from other students.

If you see this and decide to copy it without understanding the code, tweaking it & making it yours, you are fooling nobody, but yourself.
These aren't the originals.
